# Image Segmentation with Machine Learning

As part of the [2021 100 days of Data.trek challenge](1) organized by [AEBINUM](2) of Montreal University and [IVADO](3) of Quebec, I decided for my introduction to machine learning to work on computer vision, more precisely on image segmentation.

Computer vision is a field of computer science that enables computers to identify and process objects in videos and images just the way we humans do. [^0] It trains computer in understanding the visual world with the help of deep learning models to easily identify objects and then reacts accordingly. [^5]

Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments (or sets of pixels) in order to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.[^10]

# Motivation

Computer vision can bring improvements or solutions in many areas. This plurality of applications motivated my interest in the subject and prompted my decision to make image segmentation the object of my learning.

# Credits

The work that will be done here is inspired by the [data-flair](20) article on an [image segmentation project suggestion](21) as a training.
